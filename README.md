## 🚀 Why I Built This

Managing income and expenses manually across spreadsheets or notes often becomes messy and inconsistent. I wanted a simple, elegant web app that could:

* **Track my daily transactions** in real-time
* **Visualize income and expense trends** with interactive charts
* **Provide data portability** with CSV import/export
* **Work seamlessly on all devices**
* **Store data securely**, without depending on any third-party servers

So, I built **RupiTrack** — a personal finance tracker that’s fast, intuitive, and secure, powered by Firebase’s backend and React’s dynamic UI.
